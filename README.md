# Overview of Bayesian Networks

A **Bayesian Network (BN)** is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of variables and their conditional dependencies via a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**. Each node in the graph represents a random variable, while the edges denote conditional dependencies between these variables. The strength of these dependencies is quantified using conditional probability distributions.

The core strength of BNs lies in their ability to encode **Conditional Probability Distributions (CPDs)** for each variable. A CPD specifies the probability of a variable taking on a particular value given the values of its parent variables in the DAG. This probabilistic framework allows BNs to reason under uncertainty and update beliefs as new evidence is introduced.

## Key Characteristics

- **Transparency and Explainability**  
  Bayesian Networks are highly transparent, allowing users to understand and explain the reasoning behind the model's predictions. This is particularly useful in fields like medicine, where justifying decisions is crucial.

- **Flexibility and Modularity**  
  BNs can incorporate both data-driven and expert knowledge. This flexibility allows parts of the network to be updated independently, making it easier to adapt to new information or changing conditions.

- **Probabilistic Reasoning**  
  BNs use probabilistic reasoning to handle uncertainty and make predictions. This involves calculating the joint probability distribution of the variables and updating beliefs based on new evidence.

## The Power of Bayes' Rule

BNs leverage **Bayes' Rule**, a fundamental theorem in probability theory, to perform probabilistic inference. Bayes' Rule allows us to calculate the **posterior probability** of a variable (the probability after considering new evidence) given the **prior probability** (initial belief) and the **likelihood** of the evidence.

By iteratively applying Bayes' Rule through the DAG, BNs can efficiently compute the posterior probabilities of all variables in the network.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Bayesian Networks

### ✅ Advantages of BNs

- **Interpretability**  
  BNs are highly interpretable due to their explicit DAG structure. The directed edges reveal the causal relationships between variables, making it easier to understand the reasoning behind the network's predictions.

- **Efficiency**  
  BNs are computationally efficient for tasks like reasoning with limited data and performing exact inference in small to moderate-sized networks.

- **Incorporation of Prior Knowledge**  
  BNs readily integrate prior knowledge about the relationships between variables, enhancing the model's accuracy and robustness.

### ⚠️ Limitations of BNs

- **Scalability**  
  BNs can become cumbersome and computationally expensive for problems involving a large number of variables or complex relationships.

- **Learning Structure**  
  Learning the optimal structure (DAG) of a BN from data can be challenging, especially with high-dimensional datasets.

- **Limited Expressive Power**  
  BNs struggle with highly non-linear relationships between variables, potentially leading to inaccurate predictions in such scenarios.
